These two wordlists are sourced from:
  - the Ubuntu package `wamerican` version 7.1-1
  - the Red Hat Enterprise Linux package `words-3.0-22.el7.noarch`

Qualitatively, the Ubuntu word list is superior for the purposes of this
repository. The Red Hat list has many more entries, but many of these
entries are highly questionable.

Here is a sample of 25 words chosen uniformly at random from the Ubuntu
file:

  - bedraggles
  - waste's
  - reverenced
  - resuscitates
  - booze
  - Artaxerxes's
  - monograms
  - fluff
  - scrawniest
  - antisocial
  - Athena's
  - Slashdot
  - wheresoever
  - reservist
  - conquers
  - bookshelves
  - inconvenient
  - dairying's
  - burglarized
  - siesta
  - dredges
  - habituate
  - simplification
  - prodigious
  - quadrilaterals

Here is a sample of 25 words chosen uniformly at random from the Red Hat
file:

  - unvexatiously
  - quasi-victoriously
  - froghopper
  - tongs
  - unrepealed
  - locomotivemen
  - Lindblad
  - venezuelans
  - clannish
  - nominatival
  - tribesfolk
  - quott
  - uncommonly
  - Phidippides
  - injustice
  - unmolten
  - Byzantinize
  - faucets
  - velal
  - medialkaline
  - elfishly
  - krill
  - Alpine
  - filmsets
  - halfcocked

Maybe “unvexatiously”, “nominatival”, and “medialkaline” really are
words used by some people, but they’re not the kinds of words that I
want to consider for these puzzles.
