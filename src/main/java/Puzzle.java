/**
 * <p>
 * A Spelling Bee puzzle represented with character vectors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <em>character vector</em> for a set of characters is the integer whose {@code i}th bit is
 * set exactly if the {@code i}th letter of the alphabet is included in the character set. All
 * indices are zero-based, and the least significant bits are numbered first. The alphabet is fixed
 * to the 26 lowercase Latin characters as used in the English alphabet. For instance, the
 * character vector for {@code {'a', 'd', 'e', 'g'}} is {@code 0b1011001}, or {@code 89}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The character vector for a word is defined to be the character vector for the set of
 * characters in that string. For instance, the character vector for {@code "adage"} is {@code 89},
 * which is also the character vector for {@code "gagged"}. Strings like {@code "France"} and
 * {@code "vis-Ã -vis"} do not have character vectors, because they contain characters outside the
 * alphabet.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code Puzzle}s are immutable and have logical identity.
 * </p>
