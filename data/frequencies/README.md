These files were generated by running the `wordFrequencies.m`
Mathematica script on Mathematica 11.1.1, by setting the `words.csv`
input file to each of the files in the `data/words/` directory,
respectively. These input files were preprocessed to strip out all
invalid words for the standard game rulesâ€”namely, words with fewer than
five letters or more than seven distinct letters. This is just for
convenience, because running the script takes a while and it would have
taken twice as long otherwise.
